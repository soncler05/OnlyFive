Unlike traditional Gomoku, the objective in Only Five is to connect just five pieces in a row, not six or seven, to win. Enjoy the game solo or challenge a friend, as the first player to connect five pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins. Put your thinking skills to the test with Only Five.",
